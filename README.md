# Capacitor ESR test harness

Bad capacitors, if they aren't shorted or open, typically fail with a high equivalent series resistance (ESR).
You can measure ESR by building Stephen M. Powell's ESR test harness and an oscilloscope. The circuit and layout
are included, as well as information on an enclosure and front panel.

The way it works is the device sends a small, high frequency square wave through a capacitor--it can be on a
circuit board or off--and looking at the peak voltage drop of the wave form on an oscilloscope.
